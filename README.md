# react-native-template
A react native template that handles data modelling and general structure. Built on top of TDD, DRY, KISS and SOLID. We intend to export this template to React.JS also.

## Features
### Models
Based on laravel models, they easily help you save, centralize and customize. We use proxy to allow dynamic attributes.

Our models support:
- injection
- mocking
- attribute types

### Application mainframe
Our application mainframe consists in a global loading system, authentication, support for mocking, error handling, json route deserialization.

### Redux store
Our models support a bunch of custom premade stores that easily enable you to integrate them with your application.
